# Photo and Video Organizer

This script organizes photos and videos by year and month. It can use filenames or EXIF metadata to determine the date the media was created.
It supports dry run, copy, and move modes.

## Features

- **EXIF Metadata Support**: Uses EXIF metadata to get the creation date if the filename does not contain it.
- **Duplicate Handling**: Resolves duplicate filenames by appending a counter.
- **Dry Run Mode**: Simulates the organization without making any changes.
- **Logging**: Logs files that could not be processed to a specified log file.

## Requirements
